# Digital Data Rubbing
What if data visualization could be more than just numbers and efficiency, and actually engage human emotions like a personal story does?

To understand why traditional data visualization is not a great medium for connecting emotionally with sensitive topics, such as death rates in the midst of a pandemic, we need to understand how humans perceive data sets. <br>

In [The More Who Die, the Less We Care: Psychic Numbing and Genocide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318445_The_More_Who_Die_the_Less_We_Care_Psychic_Numbing_and_Genocide), Paul Slovic and Daniel Västfjäll research how people respond to death rates. In the beginning, people’s level of care increases as death rates increase, however, after the death rate passes a certain threshold, a certain degree of numbness and insensitivity kicks in. In the end, the rising numbers fail to provoke the emotion or feeling necessary to motivate action. <br>

Building upon this insight, I sought to explore and find a way of visualizing large death data sets that could also engage people emotionally. <br>

## VISUALIZATION

On Sunday, May 24, 2020, on [the front page of The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/learning/the-front-page.html), instead of a colorful mix of articles, photographs, and graphics, there was a long, solemn list of 100,000 people whose lives were lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. Readers reacted differently on whether this was a good decision or bad decision. Some appreciated that the front page paid respect to and honored the deceased. Other readers pointed out that it had poor legibility and possibly a negative effect on readers’ emotional state. <br>

From a data visualization perspective, the New York Times decision to publish these 100,000 names felt akin to some of the work I had been researching from Pentagram’s Georgia Lupi & team, creators of very inspiring data visualizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Their intent was to “inject more nuance, context and humanity into the Governor’s various graphs and charts, without sacrificing the exactitude the public has come to depend on.” Their exploration led to the redesign of COVID-19 visualizations, which introduced an imprecise dot to metaphorically represent one individual death from the virus, creating a kind of visual memorial to those who have deceased. <br>

When comparing the work of Pentagram’s Georgia Lupi & team with the dot representation, to the traditional line charts and bar charts we see representing death rates, I realized that the latter is designed to be highly legible, self-explaining, and simple, while sacrificing a sense of context and individuality. The dot representation, on the other hand, doesn’t desensitize people to death data but rather pulls people’s attention in various ways. For example, the hand-drawn style of the dots and certain text seems evocative of human vulnerability. The desaturated hues of yellow are reminiscent of town lights at night, as if life lost is emitting light in all directions, and portraying it as such is a way of paying respect to each individual. The overall composition is inviting and makes you want to stop and decipher it’s meaning.

Ultimately, these learnings from the “one dot = one death” concept became a foundational component of my first prototypes of a data visualization that could sensitize large scale death data sets.
