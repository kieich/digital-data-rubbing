What if data visualization could be more than just numbers and efficiency, and actually engage human emotions like a personal story does?

## DATA

To understand why traditional data visualization is not a great medium for connecting emotionally with sensitive topics, such as death rates in the midst of a pandemic, we need to understand how humans perceive data sets. <br>

In [The More Who Die, the Less We Care: Psychic Numbing and Genocide](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318445_The_More_Who_Die_the_Less_We_Care_Psychic_Numbing_and_Genocide), Paul Slovic and Daniel Västfjäll research how people respond to death rates. In the beginning, people’s level of care increases as death rates increase, however, after the death rate passes a certain threshold, a certain degree of numbness and insensitivity kicks in. In the end, the rising numbers fail to provoke the emotion or feeling necessary to motivate action. <br>

Building upon this insight, I sought to explore and find a way of visualizing large death data sets that could also engage people emotionally. <br>

## VISUALIZATION
On Sunday, May 24, 2020, on the front page of The New York Times, instead of a colorful mix of articles, photographs, and graphics, there was a long, solemn list of 100,000 people whose lives were lost due to the coronavirus pandemic. Readers reacted differently on whether this was a good decision or bad decision. Some appreciated that the front page paid respect to and honored the deceased. Other readers pointed out that it had poor legibility and possibly a negative effect on readers’ emotional state. <br>
